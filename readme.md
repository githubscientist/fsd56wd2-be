## NodeJS

- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

- Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.

- Node.js runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.

npm packages:

- npm is the node package manager for JavaScript.
- npm is the world's largest Software Registry.
- The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.
- Open-source developers use npm to share software.
- Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

cors: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

- CORS is a security feature implemented by browsers that restricts the resources that a web page can request from another domain outside of the domain from which the first resource was served.
- It is a mechanism that allows many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.
